Basic little cheat for WordBomb 

I've only used it in games with friends to troll; I don't advise using it in real games, but that's the exact reason you're here.

Before anyone asks "oH wHy DiD yOu mAkE a cHeAt tHen":

  I didn't say you couldn't use it for that purpose; you have free will, you can do whatever you want. It's probably not the best choice, considering that you're ruining other people's fun.

This has been a passion project. Do not expect me to fix bugs or add support for more games. You're welcome to post it in the "issues" tab but I don't guarantee a response.

It will probably be updated periodically whenever I want to work on it, but the program should just work by default, there should be no reason for it to break randomly.
  
Needs tesseract to work for now, planning to compile it so that it includes tesseract by default

f8 to auto-type

Has been optimized for consolas font, so uppercase "I"s are not confused for lowercase "l"s

This project has been reignited to update the code, create a cleaner ui, and compile it into a single .exe

I currently expect this to take a maximum of 2-3 days since the code is relatively short and optimizations are relatively simple.
