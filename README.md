Wordbomb Script

You need to download Python and Tesseract OCR

Comes in Windows version or MacOS version

paste this in command prompt to install needed Python packages:

pip install pytesseract pyautogui pillow pynput keyboard

Unzip Force Consolas extension, then load unpacked in Edge or Chrome, you dont need to do this part, but it help readability for character recognition

Currently only works for Mac, if you want for windows just delete the Tessaract path line at the top of the code

make sure when installing tesseract it is installed to your PATH

works for all wordbomb-esque games

roblox might be a little bit of a problem since the prompt appears in two places, working on a fix
