basic little cheat for wordbomb 

needs tesseract in order to work

f8 to auto-type

has been optimized for consolas font so uppercase "I"s are not confused for lowercase "l"s

This project has been reignited to update the code, creating a cleaner ui, and compile it into a single .exe
I currently expect this to take max 2-3 days since the code is relatively short and optimizations are relatively simple
